# SciHome
This code is aiming to make an interactive homepage web app to display scientific articles and relevant links in a generally accessable and readable manner.
The project began with my frustration at having to scroll through multiple web pages for my feed.
It will include a rss feed from trusted scientific sources as well as customisable links in a side bar.
